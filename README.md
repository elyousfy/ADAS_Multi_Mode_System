# ADAS_Multi_mode_System
This project is an ADAS Multi-Mode system that aims to develop and implement a system that can provide various advanced driver assistance features. The system is designed to enhance the safety and comfort of drivers and passengers The project involves hardware and software development, testing and evaluation, and integration.

## Modes:
- ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control)
- AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking)
- LKA (Lane Keeping Assist) using image processing
- LKA using IR
- LDW (Lane Departure Warning)

This project is used to demonstrate our ability to :
- Write clean and readable code.
- abstract code through layered architecture
- use meaningful naming convention
- demonstrate our ability to program drivers and microcontrollers from scratch
